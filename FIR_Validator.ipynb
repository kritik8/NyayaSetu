Using regex and spaCy NER, determine if the victim is SC/ST (based on a hardcoded sample list) and the accused is not SC/ST. If these conditions are met and insulting language is present, flag the case under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, Section 3(1)(r) and Indian Penal Code, 1860, Section 504.

        "## Summary of FIR Validator Tool Development\n",
        "\n",
        "The project aimed to build a Google Colab notebook implementing a complete FIR Validator tool. This tool was designed to process FIRs in PDF or image format, extract text using OCR, identify victim and accused names and castes, detect insulting language, and flag cases potentially falling under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, Section 3(1)(r) and Indian Penal Code, 1860, Section 504 based on specific criteria (victim is SC/ST, accused is not SC/ST, and insulting language is present). The tool was to output a structured report in JSON and plain text formats and optionally visualize triggering text.\n",
        "\n",
        "The development process involved several steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Setup:** Installation of necessary libraries, including `spaCy` and its English model `en_core_web_sm`.\n",
        "2.  **File Upload:** Implementation of a function to handle user file uploads using `google.colab.files`.\n",
        "3.  **OCR Processing:** Development of functions to extract text from uploaded PDF or image files using `pytesseract`, `pdf2image`, and `PIL`.\n",
        "4.  **Advanced Information Extraction:** Utilization of `spaCy` for Named Entity Recognition (specifically PERSON entities) and `regex` to identify potential caste mentions and insulting language based on defined patterns.\n",
        "5.  **Caste Determination:** Implementation of logic to determine if the victim is likely SC/ST and the accused is likely not SC/ST, based on a hardcoded sample list of SC/ST castes and a heuristic approach to associate caste mentions with names found in the extracted text.\n",
        "6.  **Legal Analysis:** Analysis of the caste determination results and the presence of insulting language to check for the specific conditions that trigger flagging under the specified PoA/IPC sections.\n",
        "7.  **Report Generation:** Creation of a structured report in both JSON and plain text formats, consolidating all extracted information, caste determination results, legal analysis findings, flagged laws, reasoning, triggering text snippets, and a confidence score.\n",
        "8.  **Optional Visualization:** Addition of a cell to highlight the detected triggering text snippets within the extracted text if the PoA/IPC sections were flagged.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The core logic for each step of the FIR Validator tool was successfully coded, including library setup, file handling, OCR processing, NLP/regex-based extraction, caste determination heuristics, legal analysis conditions, and report generation.\n",
        "*   The caste determination step relied on a hardcoded sample list of SC/ST castes and a basic heuristic to associate caste mentions with names based on proximity in the text. This approach was acknowledged as having limitations and potential for false positives/negatives.\n",
        "*   The legal analysis correctly implemented the check for the three triggering conditions: victim likely SC/ST AND accused likely not SC/ST AND insulting language detected.\n",
        "*   Confidence scores were assigned based on the outcome of the legal analysis, reflecting the uncertainty introduced by the heuristic methods, particularly in caste determination.\n",
        "*   The report generation step successfully combined the results from all preceding steps into structured JSON and plain text outputs, including conditional inclusion of flagged laws, reasoning, and triggering snippets.\n",
        "*   The optional visualization step was implemented to highlight triggering text using a simple marker if the legal analysis flagged the case.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The heuristic approach for caste determination needs significant improvement. Integrating external databases of castes, analyzing textual context more deeply around names and caste terms, and potentially using more advanced NLP techniques would enhance accuracy.\n",
        "*   The confidence scoring mechanism could be refined to provide more granular scores based on the certainty of each individual piece of evidence (e.g., clarity of OCR, certainty of NER for names, strength of association between name and caste mention).\n"
